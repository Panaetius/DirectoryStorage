DirectoryStorage
================

DirectoryStorage is a Storage for ZODB, the object database used by
`Zope`_.  It uses ordinary files and directories to store revisions of
ZODB objects; one file per revision per object.

The following features differentiate DirectoryStorage from other storages:

1. A very simple file format; one file per revision per object. Your
   data is not locked away inside an unfamiliar, opaque database.

2. Designed for disaster-preparedness.  Restore service after a
   disaster faster and with greater confidence.

3. Storage Replication.  Efficiently and robustly keep an online
   backup copy of your storage up to date with the latest changes from
   the master.

4. Designed for fault tolerance.  Any bugs (in DirectoryStorage, or
   elsewhere) are less likely to irretrievably destroy your data.

5. `But thats not all.  Read More...`_

Current Status
--------------

The current stable release of DirectoryStorage is `version 1.1.20`_,
released March 2011.  

Versions earlier than 1.1.4 have defects that can cause loss of
service.  It is worth upgrading at your convenience if you are using
anything earlier that 1.1.4.

Versions earlier than 1.1.2 have a serious bug that can lead to data
loss (but only if used without ZEO).  If you are using anything
earlier than 1.1.2 then you should upgrade immediately.

Current versions of ZEO have problems restoring full service with
DirectoryStorage if the ZEO server restarts while the ZEO client
remains running.  Full details in the `Zope tracker`_.
