checkds.py - DirectoryStorage checking tool
===========================================

Usage::

  checkds.py [--storage DIRECTORY]


Operation
---------

This tool performs a thorough check on the database structure.  It
reports any errors, and several mildly interesting statistics.

This tool needs to use snapshot mode to ensure that no other storage
process is using the main storage directory.  To use snapshot mode you
will need to either manually shut down those processes, or, if you are
using Zope, configure the `snapshot.py`_ tool to communicate with
Zope.  Zope will not lose read or write access to the storage.

The ``--storage DIRECTORY`` option may be omitted if checkds.py is
being run under the `snapshot.py`_ tool. In versions before 1.1.10,
use of snapshot.py was mandatory.
